React and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building robust web applications. In this post, we'll explore how to set up a new project and implement best practices for type safety.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early in development and improves code maintainability.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new project using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

## Key Benefits

1. Better IDE support
2. Catch errors before runtime
3. Improved code documentation
4. Enhanced refactoring capabilities

## Best Practices

- Always define proper interfaces for your props
- Use strict mode
- Leverage type inference when possible
- Create reusable type definitions
