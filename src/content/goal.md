# Welcome to My AI Journey

Hello, I’m Mingyuan Zhong, PhD —an introverted ML engineer with 11 years of experience still learning every day. AI moves fast, and I’d like to share what I’ve discovered.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Simple Explanations**  
  Easy-to-understand English to demystify AI concepts.  
- **Small Projects**  
  Code snippets from my experiments that aim to reduce stress and boost well-being.  
- **Practical Tips**  
  Insights from my trials, successes, and failures.  
- **Everyday Impact**  
  Examples of how modest AI features can make daily life a little better.

> **Why This Matters**  
> AI shouldn’t feel distant. If my learnings help you feel calmer or more curious, I’ve done my job.
