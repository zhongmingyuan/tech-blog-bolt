AI moves fast, and I’d like to share what I’ve discovered.\n\n## What You’ll Find Here\n\n- **Simple Explanations**  \n  Easy-to-understand English to demystify AI concepts.  \n- **Small Projects**  \n  Code snippets from my experiments that aim to reduce stress and boost well-being.  \n- **Practical Tips**  \n  Insights from my trials, successes, and failures.  \n- **Everyday Impact**  \n  Examples of how modest AI features can make daily life a little better.\n\n> **Why This Matters**  \n> AI shouldn’t feel distant. If my learnings help you feel calmer or more curious, I’ve done my job.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
